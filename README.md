# Project Proposal

## Employees System 
#### Mohammed El Belbesy 
------------------------


### Overview 

Create a program that helps a factory in managing the employees.

### Background 

My motivation to do such a project comes from my desire to build a program that can fit in a lot of fields. We can apply it with more complicated logic of course in a hospital, start-up company or even a restaurant.

### Implementation Strategy 

Create a program that provides the following operations:
 Enter your choice:
- Add new employee
- Print all employees
- filter out by age
- Update Salary by name
- End the program
The program will run forever and displays the five choices and the user input.


### Tasks 

##### Task1 

-Create Employee class : 
-the class holds data: Name, Age, and salary
-the function that prints the data 

##### Task2 

-Create EmployeesManger Class :
-the Manager class will have a list of employees and make the functionality of this list, the functions in the menu options.

##### Task3 

-Create FrontendManager Class :
-print the menu, get a choice, and call employeesManager to functionality for us.
